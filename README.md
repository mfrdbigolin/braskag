# *Braskag*: Brainfuck Interpreter [![Public license](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache--2.0-yellow?logo=spdx&logoColor=white)](./LICENSE)

A   [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)   interpreter.    This
project was not designed to be the fastest and the most efficient one; but,
it  was projected  to be  correct and  consistent.  To  achieve this  goal,
several  interpreter  options  are  designed to  suffice  for  the  various
behaviors of conflicting implementation.

Currently in a state of  work-in-progress, with the core interpreter almost
done  (except  for  the  user   input  support);  interpreter  options  are
implemented in the project, but not accessible to the user.
